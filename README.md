## Challenges

### Quantum states

Define few single-qubit and multi-qubit states. Calculate their overlaps and test their orthogonality. Automate your tests.

### Quantum Operators

Define few single-qubit and multi-qubit quantum operators. Test if they act on the states as expected, including the case of their eigenstates. Automate your tests.

### Simulation of measurements

### Quantum Teleportation
