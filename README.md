## Challenges

### Episode 1 - Quantum states

Define few single-qubit and multi-qubit states. Calculate their overlaps and test their orthogonality. Automate your tests.

### Episode 2 - Quantum Operators

Define few single-qubit and multi-qubit quantum operators. Test if they act on the states as expected, including the case of their eigenstates. Automate your tests.

### Episode 3 - Simulation of measurements

#### Quantum measurement

Implement a Python function such that, given a quantum state, number of qubits N and a number of samples M, would perform M measurements in the z-basis and return the count of how many times each of the outcome has been measured.

#### Coins challenge 1

Two coins are placed heads on the table. Nothing happens. Program a quantum simulation of that scenario. Provide quantum circuit and histogram of counts of measurement outcomes.

#### Coins challenge 2

Two coins are placed heads on the table. We flip the first coin. Program a quantum simulation of that scenario. Provide quantum circuit and histogram of counts of measurement outcomes.

#### Coins challenge 3

Two coins are placed heads on the table. We throw the second coin. Program a quantum simulation of that scenario. Provide quantum circuit and histogram of counts of measurement outcomes.

#### Coins challenge 4

Two coins are placed heads on the table. We throw the first coin and if it lands tails, we also throw the second coin. Program a quantum simulation of that scenario. Provide quantum circuit and histogram of counts of measurement outcomes.

#### Coins challenge 5

Two coins are placed heads on the table. We throw the first coin and if it lands heads, we also throw the second coin. Program a quantum simulation of that scenario. Provide quantum circuit and histogram of counts of measurement outcomes.
